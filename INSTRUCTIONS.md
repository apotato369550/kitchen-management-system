Hi Claude! The purpose of this repo is to help me make a system for my aunt. It's a kitchen management + purchase order system for her food business.

It comprises of 2 main features:
1. Raw Materials + Production Tracker
2. Purchase order tracker

1. Raw Materials + Production Tracker
Each day, she should be able to record and keep track of:
- Raw materials consumed (meat, vegetables, oil, miscellaneous i.e. packaging) measureable in any measurement (grams, cuts/pieces, heads)
- And production output (food packs, platters/bilao, contents of each food pack)

These input and outputs are to have no correlation to each other in terms of conversion. At least not yet

2. Purchase order tracker
She should be able to create, update, monitor, and manage purchase order
- Each purchase order is associated with a customer (a person, company, or entity)
- Each purchase order contains a set number of orders i.e 300 food packs, each food pack containing etc. (see production output in production tracker)
- The fullfillment of the purchase order can either be staggered (bit by bit, 100 food packs at a time, etc.) or in full. In either case, she should be able to update the purchase order (like adding comments to a youtube video kinda)

Right now, there will only be 2 main types of users. Admin (me) and management (her and her secretary).

I intend to create the site in Django, and host it on Vercel and have the database be in Postgres Supabase as a way of learning fullstack and to leverage my Python knowledge. For frontend, I also plan on using Tailwind.

I want this system SLEEK AND SIMPLE. I WANT ZERO IDEA INTERFERENCE, OR DISTRACTION FROM AI. MY VISION REIGNS SUPREME.
